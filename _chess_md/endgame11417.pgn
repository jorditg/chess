 {By shifting the position to the right, this study adds a finesse (the bishop sacrifice at move 7) to a well-known Sarychev study (see #37149 and #37150). The introductory play is quite different to the Sarychev, but not necessarily superior. As this is an adaptation of a classic study, it is not really comparable to the other studies in the tourney, and therefore I have awarded it a Special HM.} 1. Bg6+ {White will soon promote his e-pawn, after which the material balance is drawish. Black's hopes rest on a subsequent check by the rook on the e-file which will pick up a bishop.} 1... Kc4 $1 { An awkward move with respect to the a2-bishop, but the alternative leads to an immediate draw:} (1... Kd4 2. Bd2 $1 {Threatening both 3 e8Q and 3 Bc3+.} 2... Bc4 3. Bc3+ Ke3 4. Bd2+ Kd4 5. Bc3+ {repeating.}) 2. Bg5 Bb3 $1 {Black cannot do much to prevent White from promoting his pawn. This strong quiet move plays the bishop to a safe square, forces White's hand (...Ba4 is one of the threats) and prepares some counterplay should White promote his pawn.} (2... Rg3 3. e8=Q Rxe8+ 4. Bxe8 Rxg5 5. Bf7+ {draws at once}) 3. e8=Q Rxe8+ 4. Bxe8 Rf5 { This was Black's idea; it looks as if he will pick up one of the bishops.} 5. Bc1 $3 {White prepares the stalemate by burying his bishop on c1.} ({Not} 5. Be3 $2 Re5 6. Bf7+ Kb4 { and wins (note that this line would not win with Black's bishop on a2).}) 5... Re5+ 6. Kd2 Kd4 $3 (6... Rxe8 {is stalemate, and this is the conclusion of the Sarychev study. Here, however, Black can continue the fight.}) (6... Kb4 { also deserves consideration. Black's plan is to play ...Rc5 (thus tying White's mobile bishop to the diagonal b1-h7), then bring his king to d4 without allowing tactical tricks, and finally deprive the bishop of squares. This plan almost succeeds.} 7. Bg6 Rc5 (7... Rg5 8. Bd3 Rg1 9. Be2 { is an easy draw}) 8. Bd3 Ka5 9. Be4 Kb6 10. Bd3 Kc7 11. Be4 Kd6 12. Bd3 Ke5 13. Bh7 Kd4 (13... Kf4 {leads nowhere:} 14. Bd3 Kg3 15. Be4 Kf2 16. Bd3) 14. Bd3 Rc7 15. Bg6 Rc8 16. Bf5 Rc6 17. Bd3 Rc5 {Mission accomplished - there are no good squares on the diagonal b1-h7 anymore: 18.Bb1 Rh5, 18.Bg6 Rg5, 18.Bh7 Rh5 all win for Black. Still, White saves himself by the skin of his teeth:} 18. Be2 $1 Rc2+ 19. Kd1 { and Black lacks the firepower to deliver the decisive blow.}) 7. Ba4 $3 { A worthy answer in return! Everything else quickly loses a piece:} (7. Bd7 $2 Rc5 8. Be8 Rc2+ 9. Kd1 Rh2+ 10. Ke1 Rh1+ 11. Kd2 Rd1+ {or}) (7. Bg6 $2 Rg5 8. Bd3 Rg2+ 9. Be2 Bc4) 7... Bxa4 8. b3 {Threatening both bxa4 and Bb2+.} 8... Bxb3 9. Bb2+ {White is saved by the emergence of the dead bishop.} 1/2-1/2

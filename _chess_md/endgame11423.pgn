 {The finale is undoubtedly spectacular, but it is very similar to a study by Kubbel (#59944). That study is much shorter and contains less play, but while the play is more interesting here, it is a significant minus that Black starts off with 2 queens in the diagram. Also, from the solver's perspective, it is unfortunate that the solution depends so heavily on database positions of Q+P v Q which to many solvers will not be obvious wins. Solvers can hardly be expected to know such databases by heart, so they are reduced to 'assuming' that the positions are winning, which isn't totally satisfactory.} 1. Ne5+ (1.

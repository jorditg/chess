 {White must induce Black to play the move ...b5 (although it is not immediately obvious why this is so detrimental for Black), at the same time navigating around two reciprocal zugzwangs. This can only be accomplished by a surprising switchback. Such switchbacks have been seen before, but this study has more interesting play and, unlike many of the earlier examples, seems to be sound. This was far and away the best pawn ending in the tourney.} 1. Kd5 $1 {It is important to bear in mind that the position Kb2, Qa8, Ph3 v BKg1, Pf2, Ph4 with White to play is drawn since the most White can achieve is a drawn ending of Q+hP v Q. White can reach this drawn position in several different ways, but in order to win he must do more.} (1. Ke5 $2 { allows the black king access to c6:} 1... Kc6 $1 2. Kf6 (2. Ke6 b5) 2... Kd7 3.

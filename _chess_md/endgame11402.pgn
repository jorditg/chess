 {Although this study has no particular theme, it is a fascinating battle throughout and is enlivened by plenty of sacrifices, both White and Black. In all Black has four queens, which are downed one by one by White's numerically inferior force. The star move is White's 5th, by which White attempts the self-destruction of his own bishop on h7. Black can avoid this, only to fall victim to a different fate. This study contains no difficult sidelines and rated very highly for 'solver satisfaction'.} 1. Kg6 Qg2+ 2. Ng4 $1 (2. Ng5 $2 {loses to} 2... Qxb7 {, so White must first sacrifice his h2-knight.}) 2... Qxg4+ 3. Ng5 Qf5+ $1 (3... Qf4 {fails to} 4. Rb8+ Qxb8 5. Nf7# { , so Black must sacrifice his queen to gain a bit of time.}) 4. Kxf5 a2 (4... Nf3 5. Kf6 $1 Nxg5 6. Kg6 { forces mate, so Black puts his trust in his advanced pawns.}) 5. Nf7+ $3 { A truly astonishing move. White's attacking force looks rather slight in the face of Black's potential queens, and with this move White is prepared to reduce it even further.} (5. Kf6 $2 {loses after} 5... b1=Q 6. Bxb1 a1=Q+ 7. Kg6 Qa6+) 5... Kg7 $1 {Black declines the offer, because} (5... Kxh7 {loses to} 6. Ng5+ {the knight returns to g5} 6... Kh8 7. Rh7+ $1 { possible now that h7 is free} ({not} 7. Kf6 $2 b1=Q {and Black wins}) 7... Kg8 8. Kf6 b1=Q 9. Rg7+ Kf8 10. Ne6+ Ke8 11. Re7#) 6. Nd6+ $1 { This is the only check to win.} (6. Ne5+ $2 Kh6 7. Kg4 { is a very tempting try, because} 7... Ng2 $1 (7... a1=Q $2 {loses to} 8. Be4 { followed by mate. However, Black has the clever defence}) 8. Be4 Ne3+ 9. Kf4 Ng2+ 10. Kf5 Ne3+ 11. Kf6 Nd5+ { and White cannot reasonably avoid the perpetual check.}) 6... Kh8 ({Here} 6... Kh6 {loses to} 7. Kg4 b1=Q 8. Nf5+ Qxf5+ 9. Bxf5 {and mate next move.}) 7. Kf6 {Now that White has transferred his knight from g5 to d6 this move wins, because on d6 the knight blocks Black's queen check on a6.} (7. Rxb2 $2 { is another tempting false path, aiming for} 7... a1=Q $2 (7... Nf3 $1 8. Kg6 Ne5+ {with a draw (7...Nd3! also works)}) 8. Kg6 { and mate, but Black plays instead}) 7... b1=Q (7... a1=Q 8. Nf7+ Kxh7 9. Ng5+ { leads to immediate mate}) 8. Bxb1 a1=Q+ {Black manages to promote with check, but his third queen is no more help than the previous two.} 9. Kg6 Qa8 { The only way to prevent mate on the back rank.} 10. Rh7+ Kg8 11. Rg7+ (11. Ne4 {isn't possible at once due to the check on e8.}) 11... Kf8 12. Rf7+ Kg8 { Now that White has transferred his rook to f7 there is no check on e8, so White can take time out to reposition his knight.} 13. Ne4 $1 {This blocks the queen's path to g2 and threatens mate by Nf6+. Black has no choice but to surrender his third queen.} 13... Qxe4+ 14. Bxe4 Nd3 $1 { Black's last fling, threatening both to promote and to play ...Ne5+.} 15. Rf5 $1 {This sly retreat cuts out the knight check and prepares the final attack with Bd5+.} 15... Nf4+ 16. Rxf4 e1=Q { The fourth queen, but now the end is near.} 17. Bd5+ Kh8 18. Rf8# 1-0

Very good tactical study with excellent introduction involving many sacrifices by both White and Black, also related to pinning (2..Qxb3) and unpinning (3.Rb8+).  Then an original reciprocal zugzwang position occurs after a festina lente move (6.f3), also related to pinning since bQ cannot play and keep the pin on wpf7. The final play is crowned with a sacrifice of the wS with an unpinning pointe (13.Se7+). The only serious drawback is the capturing key move.  HvH} *

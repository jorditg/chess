 {Another judge might well have rated this study lower, but I feel it has several merits. The play soon leads to a position in which one might well resign in an over-the-board game, but White pulls off a remarkable save based on a mid-board stalemate. The position is natural and there are no complicated sidelines (in fact, no sidelines at all!) to distract from the main point of the study. The only real defects are the perfunctory introductory play and the fact that Black's h5-rook doesn't move during the solution. I would also have preferred to have Black to play in the initial position rather than White's king in check. A somewhat similar idea has been shown by this composer (#20388) but the current setting is considerably superior to the earlier one in that the pieces move into place in a more natural way and White's king performs a switchback.} 1. Ke6 Rd1 {Black has nothing better than to win a rook, but this certainly looks as if it should be enough to win.} 2. Rc6 $1 {The right square, setting up a battery so that White's king can return to d5 with gain of tempo.} e1=Q 3. Rxe1 Rxe1 4. Kd5+ $1 {The switchback.} Kg7 5. Rc7+ {White just ps checking, and sooner or later Black must play his king to d7 or e7...} Kf8 6. Rc8+ Ke7 7. Rc1 $1 { ...whereupon White sets up a perpetual attack on Black's rook!} Re2 8. Rc2 $1 Re3 9. Rc3 $1 Re1 10. Rc1 $1 1/2-1/2

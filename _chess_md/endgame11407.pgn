 {Despite the limited material, a very complex study - in fact, I was unable to solve it. When I saw the solution, I didn't believe that the study could be correct. After considerable manual analysis I concluded that it is sound (thanks to Marc Bourzutschky, this was later confirmed by using a database). It's really a remarkable position and a contribution to endagme theory. The study is based on a set of reciprocal zugzwangs (in all cases the pawns are on their current squares): Z1: Kc3 v Kc5, Bd1. It is obvious that this is a draw with Black to play, as if he moves his bishop White plays b4+ followed by a4. With White to play it is not so clear after 1 b4+, but Black wins by outflanking; for example, 1...Kd5 2 Kd2 Ba4 3 Kd3 Ke5 4 Ke3 Bb3 5 Kd3 Kf4 6 Kd4 Kf3 7 Kc3 Ba4 8 Kd3 Kf2 9 Kd2 Kf1 and now his king penetrates towards the white pawns. Z2: Kc3 v Ka5, Bd1. With White to play 1 Kb2 Kb6 2 Kc3 Kc5 is Z1. Black to play has nothing better than 1...Bh5, but after 2 Kd2 it's a draw. As soon as Black moves his king away from a5 White plays b4 and then a4. As we can see, occupation of d1 by Black's bishop is an important factor. Z3: Kd4 v Ka5, Be2. White to play can only continue 1 Kc3, but after 1...Bd1 we have Z2. If Black to play continues 1...Bh5, say, then 2 Kd3 (not 2 Kc3? Bd1) 2...Bd1 (or else Kd2 prevents ...Bd1) 3 Kc3 is Z2 with Black to play. If 1...Bf1, then 2 Kc3 and 3 Kc2 (or d2). Now it is possible to understand the solution.} 1. Kc7 $1 ({Not} 1. Kd7 $2 Kb7 2. Kd6 Kb6 3. Kd5 Be2 $1 {heading for the key d1-square } 4. Kd4 Bd1 5. Kc3 Kc5 {with Z1.}) 1... Ka7 2. Kc6 Ka6 3. Kd5 $1 { The first surprise.} ({Not} 3. Kc5 $2 Ka5 {and after} 4. Kd4 (4. Kd5 Bd3 $1 5. Kd4 Bc2 6. Kc3 Bd1 {or}) 4... Be2 $1 5. Kc3 Bd1 $1 {we arrive at Z2.}) 3... Ka5 $1 {Other moves are no better:} (3... Bd3 4. Kd4 Bc2 5. Kc3 { followed by Kb4 draws at once.}) (3... Be2 4. Kc5 $1 {(threatening 5.Kb4)} ({ not} 4. Kd4 $2 Bd1 5. Kc3 Ka5) 4... Ka5 {(forced)} 5. Kd4 {is Z3.}) 4. Ke4 $3 { The second surprise.} (4. Kd4 $2 Be2 {is Z3.}) (4. Kc5 $2 {(or 4.Ke5?)} 4... Bd3 5.

Kd3 $1 { The final accurate move, threatening to play 7.Kc2 or Kd2 controlling d1.} (6. Kc3 $2 {loses to} 6... Bd1) 6... Bd1 7. Kc3 {With Z2.} 1/2-1/2

 {This is a real solver's study. Some rather forcing introductory play leads to a position in which White seems all set to resign, but then he finds a miraculous defence offering a bishop and a queen. In the resulting position, he manages to hold the draw despite having a lone knight against a queen and four pawns. The final position appears original and it is an important positive feature that virtually all the units involved arrive on their final squares during the course of the play.} 1. Bc6+ Kf4 2. Ne2+ ({The tempting} 2. Bc1+ Ke5 3. Qe8+ Qe6 4. Bf4+ {fails after} 4... Kxf4 5. Qxe6 Rb2+ 6. Ne2+ Rxe2+ 7. Qxe2 h1=Q+ 8. Kxh1 Ng3+ {and Black ends up with three extra pawns.}) 2... Kg5 3. Bc1+ (3. Qxb3 Rxb3 4. Bc1+ Kh4 5. Kxh2 { transposes into the following note}) 3... Kh4 4. Qxf5 ({The alternative is} 4. Qxb3 Rxb3 5. Kxh2 g3+ 6. Kg2 Ne3+ 7. Bxe3 Rxe3 {but this is a win for Black. In general, the ending rook and two connected passed pawns against bishop and knight is a win. Here Black's king is poorly placed to begin with, but the third pawn is enough to make the win clear; for example} 8. Bf3 (8. Nd4 Ra3 9. Bd5 h5 10. Nf5+ {or else ...Kg5, followed by ...h4, etc.} 10... Kg4 11. Nxg7 h4 12. Be6+ Kf4 13. Nf5 Ra6 $1 14. Ng7 Rc6 {with an easy win}) 8... Re6 9. Nd4 Rf6 10. Ne2 ({or} 10. Bb7 Rf2+ 11. Kg1 h5) 10... Rd6 11. Ng1 (11. Nxg3 Rg6) 11... Rd2+ 12. Be2 Ra2 {and wins comfortably}) 4... Qh3+ (4... h1=Q+ 5. Kxh1 Qd1+ 6. Ng1 Rxc6 7. Be3 {gives White enough counterplay against Black's exposed king to secure the draw. The critical lineruns} 7... Rf6 { or else Bf2+ is even stronger} 8. Bf2+ g3 9. Bxg3+ $1 Kxg3 10. Qg5+ Kf2 ({or} 10... Qg4 11. Ne2+ Kf3 12. Ng1+) 11. Qg3+ Kf1 12. Qh3+ Ke1 13. Qe3+ Kf1 14. Qh3+ {with a draw.}) 5. Kh1 Rxc6 {It looks hopeless as White has only a few more checks, but now comes the real surprise.} 6. Bg5+ $1 (6. Qf2+ $2 g3 7. Qf4+ Qg4 8. Nxg3 Qxf4 9. Bxf4 g5 {is an easy win.}) 6... hxg5 7. Qh7+ ({After} 7. Qf2+ g3 8. Nxg3 Qe6 9. Nf5+ Kg4 10. Ne3+ Kh5 { Black maintains a decisive material advantage.}) 7... Rh6 8. Qxh6+ $1 gxh6 9. Ng3 $1 {A remarkable position. Black cannot win despite his huge material advantage. The only try is} (9. Ng3 Qf1+ 10. Nxf1 Kh3 {but then} 11. Ng3 { is the simplest draw.}) 1/2-1/2

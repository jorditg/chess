 {Some subtle knight play leads to a neat conclusion. Nothing special here, but quite charming. Although the final phase feels familiar, I couldn't find an absolutely identical position in a sound study.} 1. Ng4+ $1 (1. Nf3+ $2 Kg3 2. Nd2 dxc2 {draws.}) 1... Kg3 2. Nxf2 (2. Nh5+ $2 {is met by} 2... Kh4 $1 { drawing, but not} (2... Kg2 $2 3. cxd3 f1=Q 4. Ne3+ {or}) (2... Kf3 $2 3. cxd3 f1=Q 4. Nh2+ {and White wins in both cases.})) 2... dxc2 3. N2d3 $1 (3. N4d3 $2 c1=Q 4. Ne4+ Kxh3 5. Nxc1 h5 $1 {is a database draw because the crucial move Ke4 is unavailable here (see the next note).}) 3... c1=N $1 {The best chance.} ({After} 3... c1=Q { White can of course still play 4 Nxc1, but he has an alternative win by} 4. Ne2+ Kxh3 5. Ndxc1 h5 6. Ke4 $1 {with a long database win. The knight promotion eliminates this possibility, but White still wins by sacrificing both his knights.}) 4. Nxc1 $1 (4. Nh5+ $2 Kxh3 $1 5. Nxc1 Kg4 $1 { followed by pushing the h-pawn is just a draw.}) 4... Kxf4 5. Ne2+ Kf3 6. Ng1+ Kg2 {There are several studies similar to this with the black pawn on h6, but surprisingly I could only locate one with the pawn on h7 (Rinck, #62539) and that was unsound. The case with the pawn on h7 is actually the most interesting, as we shall see.} 7. Ke5 $1 { Surprisingly, this is the only move to win.} (7. Ke4 $2 Kxg1 8. h4 Kf2 9. h5 Kg3 10. Kf5 Kh4 {and}) (7. Ke6 $2 Kxg1 8. h4 Kf2 9. h5 Ke3 10. h6 Kd4 { are only draws.}) 7... Kxg1 8. h4 $1 (8. Kf6 $2 Kg2 9. h4 Kf3 10. h5 Ke4 11. h6 Kd5 {is also drawn.}) 8... Kf2 9. h5 Ke3 10. h6 {Thanks to the position of the white king, Black must now lose a tempo with his own king.} 10... Kd3 11. Kf6 { and wins.} 1-0

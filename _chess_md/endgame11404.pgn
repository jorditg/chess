 {This is a complex study which is challenging to understand even if you are just playing over the solution. After a few moves a potential stalemate situation arises, which forces White to take care. Subtle king and rook moves are required in order to deal with an underpromotion defence by Black.} 1. Kg2 $1 {The white king must head for the third rank in order to allow his rook to interpose on h4 in one line.} ({Not} 1. Kg1 $2 Rg8+ 2. Kh1 (2. Kh2 Rh7 $1 3. Rxc6 Rxh6+ 4. Rxh6 Rg2+ 5. Kh3 Rg3+ 6.

Kf3 Rb4 9. Raa6 {is similar}) 8. Raa6 Rb3 9. Rhe6 Rb1 10. Kf3 Rb3+ 11. Ke2 {White has a slow but sure win.}) 7. Ra5 $3 ({The immediate} 7. Raa6 $2 {only draws after} 7...

In fact, this was the composer's main line but the database revealed the dual win and so I have taken the main line to be 9... a1N, which avoids the dual.}) 10... a1=N 11. Rh2+ Nc2 12.

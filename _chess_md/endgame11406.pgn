 {The heavy starting position is not very much to my taste, but one must admire the remarkable play which arises. Black's two queens are held paralysed by a bishop and rook battery, and both sides manoeuvre to try to secure the best possible position after the queens have been captured. White's 5th move, allowing Black to deliver a discovered check from a queen, is especially notable.} 1. Rf1+ (1. Bc2 $2 axb5+ 2. Kb8 Bf6 3. Rf1+ b1=Q 4. Bxb1 Bxc3 5. Bxa2+ Kxa2 6. Rxf7 b4 {is a typical line. Ending up a rook ahead is no help if White has to surrender material for Black's dangerous front b-pawn. Indeed, White should force a draw quickly by} 7. Rf2+ { if he wants to avoid being worse.}) (1. Bb3 $2 Bf6 2. Bxa2 Bxc3 3. Ra4 (3. bxa6 bxa6 4. Ra4 b5 5. Rxa6 b1=Q 6. Bxb1+ Kxb1 7. Rxd6 b4 8. Rc6 Kc2 9. Bb6 (9. Kb7 Kd3) 9... Kd3 10.

Again White should force a draw as soon as possible.}) 1... b1=Q 2. Bd4 (2. Rcc1 $2 Bf6 3. Rxb1+ Qxb1 4. Rxb1+ Kxb1 5. Kxb7 axb5 6. Bxb5 g5 7. Kxb6 Be5 {is not good enough; after} 8. Be8 h4 9.

Bxb5 Kc2 {is a draw.}) 3... gxf6 4. h4 $1 { With Black's queens effectively paralysed, White fixes the weak h5-pawn ready to be attacked after the queens have disappeared. Other moves are ineffective:} (4. Ra3+ $2 {4 Rc1+ is similar} 4... Qbb2 5. Bxb2+ Kxb2 6. Rxa2+ Kxa2 7. Kxb7 ( 7. h4 Kb2 8. Bd1 Kc3 9.

Bf1 f5 { draws, as Black only has to reach h8 with his king in order to save the game.}) 4... f5 $1 {The best defence, seeking to gain counterplay by pushing the passed f-pawn. Alternatives:} (4... Qxa4 5. Ra3#) (4... Qe4 5. Rc1#) (4... Kb2 5. Rd3+ Kc1 6. Rd1#) (4... axb5 5. Ra3+ Qbb2 6. Bxb2+ Kxb2 7. Rxa2+ Kxa2 8. Bd1 f5 (8... Kb2 9. Bxh5 Kc3 10. Bxf7 Kd4 11. h5 Ke5 12. h6) 9. Bxh5 { transposing into the main line.}) 5. Bd1 $1 {Perhaps the most surprising move in the solution, allowing Black to deliver discovered check. However, White cannot waste a single tempo and must take aim at the h5-pawn without delay.} 5... axb5+ {Now there is a forced liquidation.} (5... Kb2 {loses to} 6. Rc4+ Ka3 7. Ra4#) 6. Ra3+ Qbb2 7. Bxb2+ {By taking the queens this way round, Black's king is drawn one square further away from the h-file.} 7... Kxb2 8. Rxa2+ Kxa2 9.

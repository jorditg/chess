 {This is a very complex study, involving an underpromotion by Black and reciprocal zugzwangs. White's queen finally defeats Black's collection of minor pieces thanks to Black's poor king position. However, the interesting play must be balanced against the heavy initial position, in which Black's king has been artificially placed in a box.} 1. Ne2 $1 Nxe2 2. h8=Q { Threatening Qa1+.} 2... c1=N $1 3. Qa1+ $1 (3. Qb2 $2 Bf5+ 4. Kg2 Be4+ { is perpetual check}) (3. Qe5 $4 Bc2 $1 {allows Black to transfer his bishop to the safe square a4, after which White will even lose.}) 3... Ba2 (3... Na2 $2 4. Qxb1 {wins. If White picks up a minor piece for nothing then he should win in the end by playing his king to a8 or b8 to attack Black's pawns.}) 4. Kg2 $1 {Black's minor pieces are paralysed and he must push a pawn.} 4... g5 $1 5. hxg5 $1 ({After} 5. h5 $4 g4 { White is on the wrong side of a full-point zugzwang:} 6. Kf1 Nf4 $1 7. Qxc1 Bc4+ 8. Kg1 Ne2+ {and wins}) 5... hxg5 6. Kf3 $1 {Great accuracy is required:} (6. Kf1 $4 {even loses after} 6... Nf4 7. Qxc1 (7. Kg1 Nce2+) 7... Bc4+ { followed by a knight fork.}) (6. Kh1 $4 Nf4 {also wins for Black.}) (6. Kh3 $2 {is the thematic try:} 6... Nf4+ 7. Kxg3 Nfd3 8. Kh2 g4 9. Kg3 Ne2+ 10. Kh4 ( 10. Kxg4 Nxb4) 10... Nec1 {draws as it is White to play in the reciprocal zugzwang - he cannot take on g4 because of the reply ... Nxb4. See also the note to White's 9th move.}) 6... g4+ ({Or} 6... Nf4 7. Qxc1 Bd5+ 8. Ke3 Bb3 9. Qa3+ Ba4 10. Kf3 g2 11. Kf2 g4 12. Kg1 g3 13. Qa1 Nd3 14. Qc3 { and Black loses his kingside pawns}) (6... g2 7. Kxg2 g4 (7... Nf4+ 8. Kh2 Nfd3 9. Kg3 g4 10. Kh4 {transposes to the main line}) 8. Kh2 g3+ (8... Nc3 9. Qxc3 g3+ 10. Qxg3 {and}) (8... Nd4 9. Qxd4 g3+ 10. Kg2 {also win for White}) 9. Kg2 {and Black loses his g-pawn and then a piece.}) 7. Kg2 $1 { Black is now in zugzwang and must surrender the g3-pawn.} 7... Nf4+ $1 { Transferring the knight to d3 is the best defence.} (7... Nc3 8. Kxg3 { loses both g-pawns.}) 8. Kxg3 Nfd3 (8... Nfe2+ 9. Kxg4 {wins}) 9. Kh4 $1 { Now it is Black to play in the reciprocal zugzwang.} (9. Kxg4 $2 { only draws after} 9... Nxb4 $1 10. Qxc1 Be6+ $1 11. Kf3 {(say)} 11... Nc6 12. Qa3+ Na5 {. This kind of position cannot be won, since the only weakness in Black's position is the a7-pawn. White can win it but, for this, needs to have wKa8 and wQb8, and with White's pieces so far out of play Black draws comfortably by ...b4 and ...Kb5, etc.}) (9. Kh2 $2 Nf4 $1 10. Kg3 Nfd3 { is a loss of time.}) 9... g3 {The second g-pawn goes and soon after a piece.} 10. Kxg3 Nxb4 { Or else White wins a piece and then marches his king to attack a7 or b7.} 11. Qxc1 {There is no saving check on e6 here.} 11... Bb3 (11... Nc6 12. Qa3+) 12. Qa3+ {and wins} 1-0

The hope that White places in his two passed pawns seems to go up in smoke almost at once, but a double pawn sacrifice followed by the quiet 7.Kc4 forces Black into an irrevocable pin in 4 variations (mirror symmetry on c5 and d6). It's amazing that the position after 7.Kc4 has not been discovered before! A similar fourfold pin has been shown by .Herbstman (Shakhmaty vSSSR 1953, 4th HM), but the mechanism is comparatively clumsy." "PS: After the confirmation period a serious anticipation was pointed out to the judge. E. Pogosyants, 1983 [0313.20e2e8]"} 1/2-1/2

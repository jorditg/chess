 {This study is based on a position of reciprocal zugzwang (arising after White's 3rd move), with accompanying thematic try. The fact that this position is reciprocal zugzwang is not at all obvious, and it is perhaps slightly unfortunate that White arrives at it by playing the most direct moves. However, the content, plus the natural initial position, means this study deserves its high ranking.} 1. e5 $1 (1. d5 $2 Kxe4 2. d6 c5 {is an easy draw.}) 1... Kxd4 ( 1... Ke4 2. e6 Bd8 3. Nf5 $1 Kxf5 4. e7 Bxe7 5. Kxe7 {wins}) 2. e6 ({Not} 2. Ng4 $2 Bc7 $1 3. e6 Bd6 {winning the b-pawn and drawing.}) 2... Bd8 3. Ng4 $3 { This move gives rise to a reciprocal zugzwang.} ({After} 3.

He clearly cannot move his bishop, and king moves allow White to improve the position of his knight:} (3... Kd5 4. Ne3+ Kd4 5. Ke8 $1 Bg5 6. Kd7 Kc3 7. Nc2 {wins}) (3...

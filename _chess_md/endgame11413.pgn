 {In this complex study the white king is totally immobilised on the square h1 and the first part of the study revolves around Black's attempts to avoid stalemating White. By the time this situation has been resolved, the position has reduced to a database position of R+B+P v R. Then everything depends on a series of linked reciprocal zugzwangs. Another judge might have placed this study higher, but in my mind the artificial initial position and lack of 'solver appeal', due to its great length and analytical complexity, weighed against it.} 1. Re7 $1 {A spectacular initial move.} (1. Rxa3+ $2 Rxa3 2. Re7 Nb5 3. c7 Rf3 {we will see this move several times during the solution} 4. Rf7 Nd4 5. gxf3 Ne6 {and Black has too much material.}) (1. Rd7 $2 Nxa6 2. Rd1+ Kb2 3. c7 Rf3 {also wins.}) 1... Ne6 (1... Nb5 2. Rxe3 {and}) (1... Rxe7 2. Rxa3+ { are immediate draws.}) 2. Rxa3+ (2. Rxe6 $2 Rxe6) (2. c7 $2 Re1 {and}) (2. Rea7 $2 Nc5 3. Rxa3+ Kb2 {are all lost for White.}) 2... Rxa3 3. c7 (3. Rxe6 $2 Be3 4. Rd6 Kb2 5. Rd1 Bc1 6. c7 Ra1 7. c8=Q Nxc8 {and}) (3. Ra7 $2 Ng5 4. Rxa3+ Kb2 {win for Black.}) 3... Rf3 $1 { By putting his rook en prise Black defeats White's attempts to force stalemate. } (3... Ng5 4. c8=Q Nxc8 5. Re1+ Kb2 6. Rb1+ {is an immediate draw.}) 4. c8=Q Nxc8 5. Rxe6 Nb6 {Black must hurry with his knight. After} (5... Bd4 {or}) ( 5... Na7 {White simply takes on f3 and then pushes his f-pawn.}) 6. Rf6 (6. gxf3 Nd5 {stopping the advance of the f-pawn} 7. Rg6 (7. f4 g2+) 7... Bf2 8. f4 Ne3 9. Rg5 Nd1 10. f5 Be1 11. Kg2 Nf2 12. Rh5 Nd3 {wins for Black.}) 6... Rf2 { Threatening to take on g2.} 7. Rxb6 Rxg2 8. Rb3 Rb2 {Necessary to prevent Rb1+. } 9. Ra3+ $1 (9. Rxg3 $2 Rb1 { is a database win, but the method is far from simple. One line runs} 10. Rg8 Rf1 11. Rg2 Kb1 12. Re2 Kc1 13. Ra2 Rf4 14. Re2 Kd1 15. Rg2 Rf5 16. Rg5 Rf1 17. Rg2 Ke1 18.

Rh7 Ke2 35. Rg7 Bf2 { Finally Black can extract his bishop from g1. If White takes the pawn, Black has a winning R+B v R position.} 36. Rg6 (36. Kxh2 Kf3 {wins}) 36... Rf3 37. Kxh2 (37. Ra6 Bg3 {is a standard win as described in various endgame books}) 37... Kf1 {with a won R+B v R ending.}) 9... Ra2 (9... Kb1 10. Rxg3 Kc1 11. Rg7 Rb3 12. Rg3 {transposes to the main line at move 21}) 10. Rxg3 Kb1 11. Rg7 { White's rook needs plenty of checking distance, because it must be able to check along the rank without being takenbyBlack'sbishop} ({Thus} 11. Rg8 { is also good, but other moves fail; for example,}) (11. Rg6 $2 Kc1 12. Rc6+ ( 12. Rg2 Ra4 13. Rg4 Ra1 14. Rg2 Rb1 {zugzwang} 15. Re2 Rb4 16. Rg2 Kd1 {wins}) 12... Kb2 13. Rc3 {the problem is that White cannot check on b6 here} Ra4 14. Rc8 Kb1 {and Black has freed his pieces, leading to a win as in the note to White's 9th move.}) (11. Rg2 $2 Ra1 { is a reciprocal zugzwang with White to play; Black wins after} 12. Re2 Ra3 13. Rg2 Rf3 14. Rg3 Rf1 15. Rg2 Kc1 {and so on.}) 11... Ra3 {Lifting the stalemate. If Black plays his rook along the rank (except for b2) then White just gives perpetual check.} ({Now} 11... Kc1 12. Rc7+ Kb2 13. Rb7+ {draws}) (11... Rb2 12. Rg2 {is also a draw.}) 12. Rg3 Ra4 13. Rg4 Ra5 14. Rg5 Ra6 15. Rg6 Ra7 16. Rg7 Ra8 17. Rg8 Ra1 {Sooner or later the rook must move to a1.} 18. Rg2 { This is a reciprocal zugzwang.} Kc1 19. Ra2 Rb1 20. Rg2 {Zugzwang} Rb3 21. Rg3 Rb4 22.

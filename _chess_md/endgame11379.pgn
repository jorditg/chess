 {This position is a truly astounding discovery. White sacrifices a piece to reach a drawn position in which he is two whole minor pieces down and has just one pawn on the second rank. The refusal to capture Black's bishop at move 4 is especially surprising. Other studies with this concluding material balance (such as Avni #20415) have involved stalemate, but this one is based on a positional draw. This study shows that there are still simple and striking positions waiting to be discovered.} 1. Nh8 $1 {Black's bishop occupies a dominating position which makes it hard for White to activate his pieces. White's first move clears g6 in order to play his king to that square.} ({ The alternative is} 1. Kg7 $143 Nd6 2. Ne5 g3 {but Black can secure his pawn on g3 and gradually improve the position of his pieces. Of course, he must avoid the exchange of knights, which leads to a positional draw provided White's king can reach f1. Although the win is not easy, it can be accomplished in the end; for example,} 3. Kg6 Bd8 $1 {stopping the white king reaching e6, after which it is very hard for Black to displace the centralised white pieces} 4. Kh5 Ne4 5. Kg4 Bc7 6. Kf3 Nd2+ 7. Ke3 (7. Ke2 $144 Nb3 8. Ng6 Kc6 9. Kf3 Nd4+ 10. Kg4 Kd5 11. Nf4+ Ke4 $19 {wins}) 7... Nf1+ 8. Ke2 Nh2 { this prevent s the white king approaching the g3-pawn and gives Black time to bring his own kingup} 9. Nd3 Kc6 10. Ke3 Kd5 11. Nb4+ Ke5 12. Nc6+ Kf5 13. Nd4+ Kg4 14. Nc2 Bb6+ 15. Ke2 Kf4 $18 {followed by ...Ng4, with a technical win.}) 1... Ne5 { The only winning chance is to prevent White's king moving immediately to g6.} ( {After} 1... Nxh8 $144 2. Kxh8 Kc6 3. Kg7 Kd5 4. Kg6 Be3 {Black cannot move his bishop to f4 or h4 without losing his pawn, so he loses another tempo later when White attacks the g3-pawn with his king} 5. Kf5 g3 6. Kg4 Bf2 7. Kf3 Kd4 8. Ke2 $1 $11 {the king reaches f1, with a standard positional draw.}) 2. Nf7 $3 {Quick action is necessary, or Black just approaches with his king, but this move is simply unbelievable. Already one piece down, White offers a second one! Black must accept as both his minor pieces are under fire.} Nxf7 3. Kg6 $1 Ne5+ $1 ({The best try is to sacrifice the bishop, as} 3... Kc6 $144 4. Kxf7 Kd5 5. Kg6 $11 {draws as in the note to Black's first move.}) 4. Kf5 $1 { Declining the offer.} (4. Kxg5 $143 {loses after} Kc6 $1 5. Kf4 Kd6 $1 { gaining the opposition} 6. Ke4 (6. Kf5 $144 Kd5 $19 {wins}) 6... Ke6 7. Kf4 Kf6 8. g3 Ke6 9. Kg5 Kd5 10. Kf5 Kd4 11. Kf4 Kd3 $1 $19 {and the g3-pawn falls.}) 4... Nf7 { Amazing but true; Black cannot win despite being two clear minor pieces up.} ( 4... Nf3 $144 5. Kxg4 $11 {and}) (4... Bf6 $144 5. Kxf6 Nf3 6. Kf5 Nh2 7. Kf4 $11 {are both clear draws.}) 5. Kg6 Ne5+ 6. Kf5 $1 $11 1/2-1/2
